      Pork can be used for many things. One of these things is, of course eating the animal. However, there are also byproducts of the animal. These byproducts are used in clothing items, medical items, and everyday items.

      The Medical Field and Pigs

      Pigs have produced many items for the medical industry. These items include insulin for diabetes patients as well as valves for human heart surgery.These uses arew very huge for many patients who have diabetes as of right now there is not a cure. So by using pigs for food and to have a health benefit is really beneficial. I noted that insulin is really good for patients with diabetes, but the heart valves are beneficical as well. If there is not enough human heart valves rather than letting the patient not survive they are able to treat him. This is only valid if the heart valve is compatible with the person. Otherwise, this would end up being a bad thing for that patient.

      In the clothing industry pig products are made to make suede for suede shoes. This is pretty much all that is made from pigs for clothing. Shoes are an important part of the clothing industry and pigs help produce a certain style of shoe. Suede is a very nice fuzzy material that is still commonly used in shoes today. This again is another reason why pigs are so great. It's not just the meat that tastes good, but they also produce a material for a good shoe.

      There are a lot more everyday use and miscellaneous items than there are for both medical items and  clothing items.For starters, pigs produce lard and help produce shaving creams, soaps, and make-up. They can aslo produce the materials needed to make water filters, insulation, and adhesives. Pigs can make really cool things other than just meat.
