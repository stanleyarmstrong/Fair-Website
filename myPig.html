  <p>
    The breed of my hog is a hampshire. This is noticeable by the black on the face and in the rear of the hog. It is also noticeable by the belt in the middle of the hog. This breed is most notable for its hams hence the name hampshire.

  <p>
    Well he is showing at the Santa Clara County Fair. He has already shown this week, but is in the large animal barn.He is a very calm hog and will most likely be sleeping if you visit him in the large animal barn.

    Why FN2187?
  </h1>

<div class = "paragraphs">
  <p>
    Well I am a fan of Star Wars and because he was a male hog, I said "Why not?". I was also searching for a cool name and I thought Star Wars. I also felt a connection for the new movie, as during my band clas at school we played "The Jedi Steps and Finale" by John Williams.

    How much will he go for at auction?
  </h1>
</div>
<div class = "paragraphs">
  <p>
    Well right now, he will most likely go for $6.75 per pound at the auction. He will most likely be purchased by Justin Kromelow. If you would like to add on to the purchase that would be greatly appreciated.
