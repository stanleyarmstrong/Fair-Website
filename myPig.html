    The Breed

  <p>
    The breed of my hog is a hampshire duroc cross. This is noticeable by the red on the face and in the rear of the hog. It is also noticeable by the belt in the middle of the hog. This breed is most notable for its hams hence the name hampshire.

    Where is he showing?

  <p>
    Well he is showing at the Santa Clara County Fair. He has already shown this week, but is in the large animal barn.He is a very calm hog and will most likely be sleeping if you visit him in the large animal barn.

    Why Carrot Top?
  </h1>
</div>
<div class = "paragraphs">
  <p>
    Well I am not a fan of his comedy. I am a fan of his stage name. Considering the hog is orange in the front and in the rear, I figured "Carrot Top is a perfect name for the hog!". So the name has sticked ever since.

    How much will he go for at auction?
  </h1>
</div>
<div class = "paragraphs">
  <p>
    Well right now, he will most likely go for $6.75 per pound at the auction. He will most likely be purchased by Justin Kromelow. If you would like to add on to the purchase that would be greatly appreciated.
